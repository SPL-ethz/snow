Numerical implementation of the initial amount of ice
=====================================================

The modeling framework that forms the basis for the SNOW python package
was derived initially by :raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2021}` (version 1.0) for
systems comprising vials arranged in two spatial dimensions, and by
:raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2022}` (version 1.1) for systems comprising vials
arranged in three spatial dimensions.

This section discusses a minor aspect of this modeling framework, namely
the numerical implementation of the initial amount of ice formed upon
nucleation. The authors realized that there are two different approaches
leading to comparable, but not identical results. These methods are
named "direct" and "indirect"; the derivation of the original
manuscripts leads to the "direct" method, while the "indirect" one
requires rearranging the enthalpy balance. This will be discussed in the
following.

With respect to numerical implementation, version 1.0 contains the
"indirect" method only, while version 1.1 supports both methods.

Model derivation
----------------

The starting point for these methods are equations
`[eqn:8] <#eqn:8>`__,\ `[eqn:9] <#eqn:9>`__ and `[eqn:10] <#eqn:10>`__
of the manuscript by :raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2021}`. For the sake of
consistency, the original numbering of equations is used within this
comment. The relevant equations are:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:8}
   \dot{Q}_{(m,n)} =\left( m_{\mathrm{s}} c_{\mathrm{p,s}} + m_{\mathrm{\ell},(m,n)} c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}} + m_{\mathrm{i},(m,n)} c_{\mathrm{p,i}} \right) \dfrac{\mathrm{d}T_{(m,n)}^{\mathrm{eq}}}{\mathrm{d}t} - \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} \dfrac{\mathrm{d}m_{\mathrm{i},(m,n)}}{\mathrm{d}t} \end{aligned}

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:9}
       T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{(m,n)} ~= T_{\mathrm{m}} - k_{\mathrm{f}} b_{\mathrm{s},(m,n)} = T_{\mathrm{m}} - \frac{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{M_{\mathrm{s}}} \left( \frac{m_{\mathrm{s}}}{m_{\mathrm{w}} - m_{\mathrm{i},(m,n)}} \right)\end{aligned}

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:10}
    \left(T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{(m,n)} - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}\right) c_{\mathrm{p}} m_{\mathrm{v}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} m_{\mathrm{i},(m,n)} \end{aligned}

These equations are based on the total mass of the formulation in a
vial. When implementing these equations in the MATLAB and python codes,
rescaled version based on the ice fraction
:math:`\sigma_{(m,n)} = \frac{ m_{\mathrm{i},(m,n)}}{m_{\mathrm{w}}}`
were derived:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:11}
   \frac{\dot{Q}_{(m,n)}}{m_{\mathrm{v}}} =\left( w_{\mathrm{s}} c_{\mathrm{p,s}} + (1- w_{\mathrm{s}})(c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}} + \sigma_{(m,n)}( c_{\mathrm{p,i}}-c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}}) \right) \dfrac{\mathrm{d}T_{(m,n)}^{\mathrm{eq}}}{\mathrm{d}t} - \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} (1-w_{\mathrm{s}}) \dfrac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_{(m,n)}}{\mathrm{d}t} \end{aligned}

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:12}
       T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{(m,n)} = T_{\mathrm{m}} - \frac{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{M_{\mathrm{s}}} \left( \frac{w_{\mathrm{s}}}{1 - w_{\mathrm{s}}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{1 - \sigma_{(m,n)}} \right) = T_{\mathrm{m}} - D  \left( \frac{1}{1 - \sigma_{(m,n)}} \right) \end{aligned}

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:13}
    \left(T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{(m,n)} - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}\right) c_{\mathrm{p}} m_{\mathrm{v}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} \sigma_{(m,n)} (1 - w_{\mathrm{s}})  \end{aligned}

Equations `[eqn:11] <#eqn:11>`__ and `[eqn:12] <#eqn:12>`__ form a
system of two equations in two unknowns. When inserting

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:14}
       \dfrac{\mathrm{d}T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{(m,n)}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -D \dfrac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_{(m,n)}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \frac{1}{(1 - \sigma_{(m,n)})^2 } \right)\end{aligned}

into the enthalpy balance, the following expression is obtained:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:15}
   - \frac{\dot{Q}_{(m,n)}}{m_{\mathrm{v}}} =  \dfrac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_{(m,n)}}{\mathrm{d}t}  \left( \left( w_{\mathrm{s}} c_{\mathrm{p,s}} + (1- w_{\mathrm{s}})(c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}} + \sigma_{(m,n)}( c_{\mathrm{p,i}}-c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}}) \right) D \left( \frac{1}{(1 - \sigma_{(m,n)})^2 } \right) + \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} (1-w_{\mathrm{s}}) \right)\end{aligned}

Indirect method
---------------

This method relies on the enthalpy balance (eqn
`[eqn:8] <#eqn:8>`__,\ `[eqn:11] <#eqn:11>`__) to calculate the amount
of ice formed upon nucleation. In line with the overall description of
freezing used in the derivation, nucleation is considered to be an
adiabatic process, i.e. it occurs fast enough that the vial does not
exchange a relevant amount of heat during nucleation. At the time of
nucleation, the enthalpy balance thus reads

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:16}
   - \frac{Q_{(m,n)}^{\mathrm{nuc}}}{m_{\mathrm{v}}} =  \Delta \sigma_{(m,n)}  \left( \left( w_{\mathrm{s}} c_{\mathrm{p,s}} + (1- w_{\mathrm{s}})(c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}} + \sigma_{(m,n)}( c_{\mathrm{p,i}}-c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}}) \right) D \left( \frac{1}{(1 - \sigma_{(m,n)})^2 } \right) + \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} (1-w_{\mathrm{s}}) \right)\end{aligned}

whereby :math:`Q^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}` is defined as:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:17}
       Q^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)} = m_{\mathrm{v}} c_{\mathrm{p,}\ell} (T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{\ell} - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)})\end{aligned}

Note that the definition of :math:`Q^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}` relies on
:math:`T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{\ell}`, the equilibrium freezing temperature of
the solution. This corresponds to the initial state at the onset of
nucleation, when no ice is present. :math:`Q^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}`
thus represents the difference in enthalpy among the supercooled
solution and its hypothetical equilibrium state. Since initially no ice
is present (i.e. :math:`\sigma_{(m,n)} = 0` and
:math:`\Delta \sigma_{(m,n)} = \sigma_{\mathrm{nuc},(m,n)}`), the
balance simplifies to:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:18}
   - \frac{Q^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}}{m_{\mathrm{v}}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{nuc},(m,n)}  \left( \left( w_{\mathrm{s}} c_{\mathrm{p,s}} + (1- w_{\mathrm{s}})(c_{\mathrm{p,\ell}} \right) D + \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} (1-w_{\mathrm{s}}) \right)\end{aligned}

Rearranging leads to the final expression for the formed ice:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:19}
   \sigma_{\mathrm{nuc},(m,n)} = \frac{T^{\mathrm{eq}}_{\ell} - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}}{D + \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{w}}}{c_{\mathrm{p}}}(1 - w_{\mathrm{s}})}\end{aligned}

Direct method
-------------

The second method relies on the use of equation `[eqn:10] <#eqn:10>`__
and its rescaled equivalent, equation `[eqn:13] <#eqn:13>`__. Again, we
insert the expression for the equilibrium freezing temperature to obtain
a system dependent only on :math:`\sigma`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:20}
    \left(T_{\mathrm{m}} - D \left( \frac{1}{1 - \sigma_{(m,n)}} \right)  - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}\right) c_{\mathrm{p}} m_{\mathrm{v}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{w}} \sigma_{(m,n)} (1 - w_{\mathrm{s}})  \end{aligned}

For the sake of simplicity, we introduce the parameter
:math:`\gamma = (1 - w_{\mathrm{s}})   \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{w}}}{c_{\mathrm{p}}}`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:21}
    \left(T_{\mathrm{m}} - D \left( \frac{1}{1 - \sigma_{(m,n)}} \right)  - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)}\right) = \sigma_{(m,n)} \gamma  \end{aligned}

Multiplying with :math:`(1 - \sigma_{(m,n)})` and rearranging yields the
following quadratic equation, which may be solved analytically:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eqn:22}
       \sigma_{(m,n)}^2 (- \gamma) +  \sigma_{(m,n)} ( T_{\mathrm{m}} - T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)} + \gamma) + D - T_{\mathrm{m}} + T^{\mathrm{nuc}}_{(m,n)} = 0\end{aligned}

Comparison of the two methods
-----------------------------

For the system studied by :raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2021}` and by
:raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2021}`, namely a 5 wt.% sucrose solution, the
predictions of both methods for the initial amount of formed ice are
compared. Figure `1 <#fig:models>`__ visualizes the predictions and the
relative error between the two methods.

   formed. Right: Relative error between the two predictions.

It is found that for the relevant range of nucleation temperatures, i.e.
-10°C to -15°C, the relative error between the predictions is below
0.1%, so that both methods may be considered as equivalent. In a second
step, we compare the impact of both methods on the freezing of a complex
system. We chose a box of 20x12x3 vials, a system discussed in detail by
:raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2022}`. This is shown in Figure `2 <#fig:box>`__.

As can be seen, no relevant difference is observed between the two model
predictions. Given that their computational costs are similar and that
both are grounded on the same set of model equations, both represent
suitable choices for implementation in the model. Thus, both methods are
integrated in version 1.1. of the SNOW package.

.. _validation:

Numerical validation of SNOW version 1.1
========================================

Similar to the validation of SNOW version 1.0, the numerical
implementation of version 1.1. is also validated by comparison with the
earlier MATLAB implementation. We refer the reader to the initial
numerical validation document of version 1.0 for a more detailed
discussion of the approach.

Here, we present simulation results for pallet freezing, the main
application of version 1.1. The model system is a pallet comprising
40x36x18 vials, in line with the systems studied in the pre-print by
:raw-latex:`\citet{Deck2022}`. The two most "extreme" storage
temperatures are considered here, i.e. -8°C and -40°C to enable a
comprehensive comparison. 128 simulations are carried out, a typical
number of repetitions used in the manuscript. The run at -8°C was
simulated for a total of 6e6 seconds, while the one at -40°C was faster
with 1e6 s.

   solidification times. Right: Distribution of nucleation times.

Figure `3 <#fig:pallet>`__ shows a close agreement between both
implementations, independent of studied storage temperature. This
indicates that both implementations may be used interchangeably for
freezing simulations.

One notable difference between the two packages, however, lies in their
runtime. Thus, the runtimes for the simulation at -8°C were compared.
The simulations were carried out on a Dell Optiplex 7070 workstation
with 32 GB RAM and Intel Core i9-9900 CPU. 8 parallel workers were
employed, resulting in runtimes of XXX min for the MATLAB implementation
and 718 min for SNOW version 1.1. Given that the system is embarassingly
parallel, the runtime may be reduced considerably by increasing the
number of workers. While the python implementation is slower, the
difference in runtime is small enough to be not a limiting factor of
use.
